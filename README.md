# 🐇 Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland — Solutions

Welcome to this open-source project providing **Jupyter Notebook solutions** to the book  
📘 [*Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland* by Chris Rackauckas and Qinyun Wang](https://www.diffwonderland.com/)  

This project contains solutions to exercises from the book, implemented primarily with **PyTorch** (instead of JAX). It aims to help learners and researchers better understand differentiable programming concepts through practical examples.

> 🧠 These solutions are written by myself and other contributors. They are **not official answers** from the authors, but are meant as references to help readers better understand the concepts and exercises in the book.

⚠️ **Note:** While the original book emphasizes the use of JAX, this project uses **PyTorch** as the main deep learning framework for solving the exercises.


## 📚 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains curated solutions — the best, cleanest, and most complete answers chosen for easy reference.
- `community/`: Contains alternative or experimental solutions contributed by the community.
